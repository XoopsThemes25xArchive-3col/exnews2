README :: EXNEWS XOOPS THEME V.2
*********************************************


This version of the theme is an update and optimization to the already existing one at www.xoops.org published by Exbanious here:

http://www.xoops.org/modules/library/singlefile.php?cid=1&lid=42

We have upgraded it to use the center blocks and above and below module content and all the html and css was redone to fix several bugs it had.


It's a 4 column, fexible theme which can be adapted in many ways.
